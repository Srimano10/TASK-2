# TASK-2
SAPMLE TEXT EMAIL : 
 1) Examine sender's email address
    	paypa1-security.com is not an official PayPal domain.

 2) Check email headers using Gmail
     From: and Return-Path: differs. SPF/DKIM fail.
    
 3) Identify suspicious links or attachments
     Text shows paypal.com but actual URL is verify-paypal.com
     .zip file might contain malware.
    
 5) Look for urgent or threatening language
     	"Account suspended", "24 hours", "Immediate action" create panic.

 6) Look for spelling or grammar errors
      “Failure to comply may result in permanent loss of access and funds” is awkwardly worded.

 7) Summarize phishing traits found

     The phishing email pretends to be from PayPal but uses the sender address paypa1@security.com. The header shows SPF and DKIM failures.
     The message contains a threat ("Your account will be suspended in 24 hours") and a fake link (paypal.com.security-check.ru) disguised as a PayPal login.
     There are grammar issues like “Click hear to resolve”. Overall, the email shows classic phishing indicators.
